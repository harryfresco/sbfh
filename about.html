        <p>U gotta know about PETER, the mastermind behind all the insane lyrics & tunes in SunbeamFlowerHead!!!! <br>
          This dude is like, a total GENIUS but also kinda weird in the best way??? He writes songs that make u feel
          <br>
          like ur floating in space but also like ur in a gas station at 3 AM questioning life. He & Harry <br>
          write everything together, like a brain-meld situation or some psychic band magic!!! He’s <br>
          always scribbling random words in a notebook, and no one knows if it’s future song lyrics or just his grocery
          list. <br>
          Also, his hair does whatever it wants, kinda like him. If u haven’t listened yet, WHAT ARE U EVEN DOING???</p>

          Thinks his reflection is plotting against him.
        <li>Only sleeps if his socks are mismatched.</li>

        <li>Believes bananas communicate through vibrations.</li>
